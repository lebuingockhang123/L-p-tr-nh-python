Problem:  Describe the purpose of the break statement and the type of problem for which it is well suited.


Solution:

    The break statement ends the loop containing it and passes control to the next statement after that loop's code
block. If the break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), break will terminate the
innermost loop.
