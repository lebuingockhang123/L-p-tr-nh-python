Problem: Explain how to check for an invalid input number and prevent it being used in a program. You may assume
that the user enters a number.


Solution:

    Often a course of action must be taken if either of two conditions is true. For example, valid inputs to a
program often lie within a given range of values. Any input above this range should be rejected with an error
message, and any input below this range should be dealt with in a similar fashion. The next code segment accepts
only valid inputs for our grade conversion script and displays an error message.
