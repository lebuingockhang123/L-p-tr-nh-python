Problem:  Translate the following for loops to equivalent while loops:
a. for count in range(100):
 print(count)
b. for count in range(1, 101):
 print(count)
c. for count in range(100, 0, â€“1):
 print(count)


Solution:

Number of spaces:  2

"""
# a
count=0
while count < 100:
    print(count)
    count +=1
# b
count=1
while count < 101:
    print(count)
    count +=1
# c
count=100
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -=1
