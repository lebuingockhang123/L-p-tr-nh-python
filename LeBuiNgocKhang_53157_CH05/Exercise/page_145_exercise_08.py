Program:  Explain the difference between structural equivalence and object identity

Solution:
    The object identity is meant for a situation where the structure of the object is not encapsulated. Here, the 2
objects are meant to be in the same object based on having the identical properties.
    Structural equivalence is meant for extending the 2 specified nodes which are connected to the similar social
environment which is hypothesized for the structural equivalence nodes.
