Program:  What is the purpose of a main function?

Solution:
    In scripts that include the definitions of several cooperating functions, it is often useful to define a
special function named main that serves as the entry point for the script. This function usually expects no
arguments and returns no value. Its purpose might be to take inputs, process them by calling other functions,
and print the results.
