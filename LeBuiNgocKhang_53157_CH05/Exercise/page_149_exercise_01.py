Program:  What roles do the parameters and the return statement play in a function definition?

Solution:
    A parameter is the name used in the function definition for an argument that is passed to
the function when it is called. For now, the number and positions of the arguments of a
function call should match the number and positions of the parameters in that functionâ€™s
definition. Some functions expect no arguments, so they are defined with no parameters.
