The first and last tasks require no design. 
Let’s assume that the text is input as a single string from the file and is then processed in tasks 2–4.
These three tasks can be designed as code segments that use the input string and produce an integer value. 
Task 5, computing the Flesch Index, uses the three integer results of tasks 2–4 to compute the Flesch Index.
Lastly, task 6 is a code segment that uses the same integers and computes the Grade Level Equivalent.
The five tasks are listed in Table 4-8, where text is a variable that refers to the string read from the file.
