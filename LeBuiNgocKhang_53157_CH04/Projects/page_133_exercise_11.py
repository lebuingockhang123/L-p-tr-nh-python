Program: Jack just completed the program for the Flesch text analysis from this chapter’s case study. His supervisor,
Jill, has discovered an error in his code. The error causes the program to count a syllable containing consecutive
vowels as multiple syllables. Suggest a solution to this problem in Jack’s code and modify the program so that it
handles these cases correctly.

Solution:

Enter the file name: test11.txt
The Flesch Index is 78.54500000000002
The Grade Level Equivalent is 4
3 sentences
18 words
26 syllables
