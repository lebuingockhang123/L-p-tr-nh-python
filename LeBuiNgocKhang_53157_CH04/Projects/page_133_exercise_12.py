Program: The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file. The
format of each line of the file is the following:
<last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the
employees for the given period. The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line
should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.

Solution:

Enter the file name: test12.txt
Name            Hours      Total Pay
John               26         196.56
Peter              22         104.50
David              11          35.42
Ronaldo             3           0.45
Messi               3           0.51
