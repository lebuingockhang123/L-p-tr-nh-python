Program: Describe how a row-major traversal visits every position in a two-dimensional grid.



Solution:
    A row-major traversal starts at position (0, 0) in a grid and visits each position in a given row before
moving on to the next row.  Thus, the next position visited, if there is one in the first row, would be ((0,1).
