Program: How would a column-major traversal of a grid work? Write a code segment that
prints the positions visited by a column-major traversal of a 2-by-3 grid.

Solution:
 A column-major traversal starts at position (0,0) in a grid and visits each position in a column before moving
on to the next column.  Here is a loop that prints the positions of a 2 by 3 grid in column-major order.
