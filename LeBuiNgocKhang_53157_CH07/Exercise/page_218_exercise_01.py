Program: Explain the importance of the interface of a class of objects.

Solution:
    The set of methods of a given class of objects is called its interface. This is another important
idea in object-based programming. Programmers who use objects interact with them through
their interfaces. Thus, an interface should contain only enough information to use an object
of a given class. This information includes method headers and documentation about the
methodâ€™s arguments, values returned, and changes to the state of the associated objects.
