Problem: Jack says that he will not bother with analysis and design but proceed directly to coding his programs.
Why is that not a good idea?
Solution:
    If Jack would not bother with design and analysis process, when he would not be able to understarnd the basic
funtionality flow of the problem. Understanding of problem is requied before the actual implenmentation to create
a prototype of the program, otherwise the programmer can lose track.
