Problem: How does a Python programmer round a float value to the nearest int value?

Solution:
 - To round a float to the nearest int value, round() funtion is used which gives the rounded off value of float value
 - If the value after decimal point is greater than 0.5, then round() funtion returns the ceil value of the float
 value otherwise it will return the floor value of the float value.
