Problem: List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they accomplish
Solution:
   + Analysis—The programmers determine what the program will do. This is sometimes viewed as a process of clarifying
the specifications for the problem.
   + Design—The programmers determine how the program will do its task.
   + Implementation—The programmers write the program. This step is also called the coding phase.
   + Integration—Large programs have many parts. In the integration phase, these partsare brought together into a
smoothly functioning whole, usually not an easy task.
