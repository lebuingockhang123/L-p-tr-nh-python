Problem: Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums.
The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five
Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program should prompt the
user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.

Solution:
Enter the number of new videos: 18
Enter the number of oldies: 4
The total cost is $: 62.0

# compute the results
totalCost= newOnes * NEW_RENTAL +  oldOnes * OLDIE_RENTAL
# display the results
print("The total cost is $: "+ str(round(totalCost, 2)))
