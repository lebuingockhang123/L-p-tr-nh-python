Program: Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function
definition can support this property of an algorithm.

Solution:
    When we have a general class of problems. We'll create a function to solves those problems. Then, we can
    call a that function to use many case. Due to, we can save time, avoid against operates.
