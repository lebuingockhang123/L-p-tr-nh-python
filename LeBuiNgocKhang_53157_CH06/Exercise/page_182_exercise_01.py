Program: In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?

Solution:
    - In top-down design, you decompose a complex problem into a set of simpler problems and solve these
    with different functions. In some cases, you can decompose a complex problem into smaller problems
    of the same form.
    - Recursive design can solved the sub-problems when call the same function. And the resulting functions
    are called recursive functions.
