Problem:What role do translators play in the programming process?
Solution:
   A translator to convert the high-level program code into executable code. Because it is possible for a programmer
to make gramatical mistakes even when writing high-level code, the translator checks for syntax errors before it
completes the translation process. If it detects any of these errors, the translator alerts the programmer via
error messages. The programmer then has to revise the program.If the translation process succeeds without a syntax
error, the program can be executed by the run-time system.
