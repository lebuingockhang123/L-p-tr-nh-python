Problem:  Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other programming languages?
Solution:
    Python keeps track of indentation which is not useed by other programming languages but other langauages use
other syntax like square brackets and curly-braces for representing a book of code
    Less syntax rules is python results in use up less number of symbols and thus decrease the chances of syntax
error.
